# A Problem Squared Zero Three Six = Score Menu Sets

Arbitrarily large orders that will make your waiter sweat in computation.

## Maths (not rigorous, a physicist's job)

Menu of size $N$ (i.e. N different items are in the menu) let's have $S={s_0, ..., s_i, ..., s_{N-1}}$ the set all menu items.

We note $\alpha_i$ the desired quantity of the ith item. 

To write it with a specific base, we simply need to split it.
The number of times the number must be repeated with quantity $(k-1)$: 

$u_i=\alpha_i // (k-1)$ (with $//$ being integer division).

The position of the menu item being $i$, to add a second instance of it, we'll place it naturally at $S+i$, then at $S*2+i$ etc... $u_i$ times in total (counting $S*0$). Then, another repeat of quantity $\alpha_i \mod (base-1)$ with exponent $S*u_i+i$. 

The ith item number is:

$O_i=\sum_{r=0}^{u_i-1} (k-1) k^(r*S+i) +(\alpha_i \mod (base-1))$

then, your order is a sum of all item-numbers : $O=\sum_{i=0}^n O_i$

I hope Dexter can confirm my working out is in order.

## Python (a random person offering you to run their code on your computer? Not suspicious at all)

simply run menu.py, I did not bother creating a nice interface, sorry. Only two inputs: the base and the menu order array that looks like this:
```
my_order=[0,0,2,15,0,3,0]
``Ì€ 

The output should be something like:

```
> python menu.py
Order with classical quantities: [0, 0, 2, 15, 0, 3, 0]
Base chosen: 5
Order with computed quantities and item index for each item: [0, 0, 50, 178816986123047375, 0, 9375, 0]
Final order: 178816986123056800

### I changed the source to use the sanity check

> python menu.py
Order with classical quantities: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
Base chosen: 5
Order with computed quantities and item index for each item: [1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, 15625]
Final order: 19531
```
